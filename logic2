1.MAKE BRICKS
"""
  We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of
  small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). Return True if it 
  is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a 
  little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops. 
  """
  SOLUTION:
  
  def make_bricks(small, big, goal):
  res=goal
  res-=5*min(big,goal/5)
  return res-small<=0
  
2.Lone_Sum
  Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values 
  is the same as another of the values, it does not count towards the sum.
  SOLUTION:
  def lone_sum(a, b, c):
  sum=0
  sum+=a if a not in [b,c] else 0
  sum+=b if b not in [a,c] else 0
  sum+=c if c not in [a,b] else 0
  return sum
